# Morocco's Phosphate Value Chain

**Where value is created and where it leaves the system**

This interactive map explores Morocco's role in the global phosphate economy.

Morocco holds about 70% of the world's phosphate reserves. The country extracts the raw mineral and processes it into phosphoric acid and bulk fertilizers, which are exported worldwide. At the same time, higher-value specialty phosphate derivatives are still imported after further transformation abroad.

## The visualization shows:

- **major phosphate mines and industrial hubs inside Morocco**
- **domestic transport links between extraction and processing zones**
- **export destinations for phosphate rock, phosphoric acid, and fertilizers**
- **import origins of specialty downstream phosphate products**

The aim is to reveal how far Morocco's industrial transformation currently goes and where additional value is captured elsewhere in the global supply chain.

## Data

**Trade flows** are based on World Bank WITS (UN Comtrade) partner tables
(2024 data for fertilizers and phosphoric acid, 2023 for phosphate rock and specialty imports).

**Industrial sites** follow publicly documented OCP and Phosboucraa operations.

**Global reserve estimates** from USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025 and the African Development Bank phosphate factsheet.

## Features
